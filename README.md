# Man Tab

Man Tab is a Chrome extension designed to help you efficiently manage your browser tabs. It provides a clear, organized interface to find, filter, and interact with your open tabs, reducing clutter and improving your browsing experience.

## Features

- **Search and Filter:** Instantly search through your open tabs by title or URL. Apply filters to view tabs based on their inactivity period (e.g., inactive for more than a day, a week, or a month).
- **Sort Tabs:** Organize your tabs by activity, title, or URL to quickly find what you need.
- **View Modes:** Choose between a simple list view or a grouped view that organizes tabs by domain.
- **Tab Actions:**
  - **Pin Tabs:** Keep important tabs accessible by pinning them.
  - **Go to Tab:** Jump directly to any tab from the extension's interface.
  - **Close Tabs:** Close single or multiple selected tabs at once.
  - **Bookmark Tabs:** Save a selection of tabs to a new bookmark folder.
  - **Save as MHT:** Save selected tabs as `.mht` files for offline viewing. If multiple tabs are selected, they are bundled into a single `.zip` archive.
- **Session Management:**
  - **Save Sessions:** Save a group of selected tabs as a session to restore them later.
  - **Restore Sessions:** Reopen all tabs from a saved session in a new window.
  - **Delete Sessions:** Remove saved sessions you no longer need.
  - **Import Sessions:** Load sessions from a JSON file.
  - **Export Sessions:** Save all your sessions to a JSON file for backup.
